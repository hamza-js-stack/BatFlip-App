I built a responsive sports equipment e-commerce website using React.js and Vite. This project focuses on cricket gear such as bats, gloves, and helmets. The website features a clean and modern design with light blue and black theme toggling support. Users can browse through popular cricket equipment displayed in beautiful product cards. Each item has an "Add to Cart" button that dynamically updates the cart count. The cart page displays selected items with quantity controls and a mock payment section. The entire project uses React components, state management with useState, and props to make the UI interactive and functional. Itâ€™s designed for learning e-commerce site development with real-world UI elements.
